# project-pages
Repository to contain the html and css files for all project web pages from Rehg Lab.
Put each new project website in a separate folder. Note: 
* PROJECTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM PAPERS!
* Don't put websites based on a single publication here
* This is for larger bodies of work, like mobile health
